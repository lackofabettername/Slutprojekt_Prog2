Slutprojekt f√∂r prog2

To add songs:
1. Create a "music" folder if one doesn't exist, it should be on the same level as src.
2. Create a folder for each song you want to add with the title you want to display.
3. Add the song with the name "song.wav".
4. Map the beats of the song in the editor or paste a finished beatmap into the same folder as the song.
